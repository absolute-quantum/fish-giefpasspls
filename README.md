# 🐟 GIEFPASS

Made with ❤️️ for FOSS and privacy


## What is GIEFPASS

A fish function

## What does it do?

It checks if your linux her entropy generation is acceptable enough and generates secure and randomized passwords for you to use in various services

## Does it use internet?

No. Unless you don't have the required packages

## Why would I use this?

Why not? Generating secure passwords should be ALWAYS done.

## I don't have fish, can I use this with bash?

No, use fish (`apt install fish`) BOOM, you are set! 

*And: I might create a python script for it because python rulez*

## Alright alright, how do I install this crap?

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absolute-quantum/fish-giefpass/master/giefpass.sh /etc/fish/conf.d/ && exec fish`

## And how should I use it?

With the command `giefpass`
